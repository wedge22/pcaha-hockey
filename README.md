# pcaha-hockey
This project is related to amateur hockey for my sons league, I want to make it easier for the Managers to enter the scheduled games into the Sports Engine application without having to pay the $500 API access costs associated with the Sports Engine app. Currently all the scheduled games for all teams within the PCAHA appear on the website, but our team managers have to manually enter all of the games into the SE app. I want to create a program that can scrape the PCAHA page for each specific team, create a csv file that is formated as per the SE app and then have the manager of each team upload that file and save themselves a lot of time.
